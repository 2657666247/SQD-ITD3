Related implementation and model of SQD-ITD3 algorithm
The trained neural network model is integrated into the intelligent transportation system to enhance decision-making and traffic control optimization.  The framework employs parameter sharing and distributed learning to achieve scalability, improve generalization across heterogeneous traffic environments, and facilitate cooperative learning among multiple agents.  The network architecture comprises a first hidden layer with 256 neurons and a second hidden layer with 128 neurons, enabling hierarchical feature extraction from complex state representations.  The final output layer generates two-dimensional action values, which correspond to the systemâ€™s s control decisions, thereby supporting adaptive and coordinated transportation management.
